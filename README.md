This assignment has multiple parts, follow this sequence in order. Normally I will just give you a problem and ask you to figure out how to code the solution, but for now, because we're just getting started I am going to break the assignment out into steps. Test each step using the console before moving on to the next step!

1.  Create a variable called "*firstName*", set this variable equal to the value of a prompt asking the user "What is your first name?"
2.  Create a variable called "*birthMonth*", set this variable equal to the value of a prompt asking the user "What month were you born (full month name)?"
3.  Using a series of if, if else statements determine the user's birth sign using the following as the key. Set the user's birth sign to the variable "*zodiacSign*" If the answer doesn't match any of these choices set "*zodiacSign*" to unknown.
    1.  January = Capricorn
    2.  February = Aquarius
    3.  March = Pisces
    4.  April = Aries
    5.  May = Taurus
    6.  June = Gemini
    7.  July = Cancer
    8.  August = Leo
    9.  September = Virgo
    10.  October = Libra
    11.  November = Scorpio
    12.  December = Sagittarius
4.  Place the following info to the HTML page: *firstName*, your birth sign for the month of *birthMonth* is probably *zodiacSign*."


Submit the assignment through repl as you did last week.
